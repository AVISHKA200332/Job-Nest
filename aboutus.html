        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>When Job Nest was founded in 2024, its mission was to transform the hiring process by tackling the issues that both companies and job searchers faced.

			We improved the hiring process and extended our services to a variety of industries by using cutting-edge technologies and creative approaches. Our development has been largely attributed to our focus on diversity and inclusion since we think that different viewpoints provide better results.
